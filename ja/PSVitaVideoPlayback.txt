! PSVita: Video Playback
Unity supports the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 standard format. For more information see the documentation at https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/vita-en,Encoding-Users_Guide-vita,Overview/1/

Full-screen and Render-to-texture video playback on Vita can be done using functions in the ''PSVitaVideoPlayer'' class.

The PSVita Samples -> Video unity package included with the PSVita Addon has working example of video playback both fullscreen and as a RenderTexture.

!!Prerequisites
#Video files must be placed in the PROJECT\Assets\StreamingAssets folder. See [[http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/index.php?n=Main.PSVitaProjectStructure | Project Structure]] for more details.
#Specify a relative path when loading video files on the PSVita: Raw/movie.pam.

!!Fullscreen video
You can render fullscreen, in the background by:
#Passing a null value to the render texture parameter when initializing the VideoPlayer with PSVitaVideoPlayer.Init
#Updating the VideoPlayer in ''OnPostRender'' by calling ''PSVitaVideoPlayer.Update''

!!Video as RenderTexture
You can render to a Texture by:
#Passing a render texture when initializing the VideoPlayer with ''PSVitaVideoPlayer.Init''
#Updating the VideoPlayer in ''OnPreRender'' by calling ''PSVitaVideoPlayer.Update''
