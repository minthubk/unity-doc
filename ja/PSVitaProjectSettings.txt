!!Player Settings
!!Icon 
The Icon (Override for PSP2) option should be ticked in order to add a Still Image icon. This icon is used on the PSVita Home screen.

''Image Format''
* 128x128 pixels in size
* PNG

More information on the Still Image Icon can be found at https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/vita-en,Content_Information-Specifications-vita,Still_Image_Icon/1/

!!Splash Image
The Splash Image or Start-up Image will immediately display when the gate is tapped from LiveArea.

''Image Format''
* 940x544 pixels in size
* PNG

More information on the Start-up image can be found at https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/vita-en,Content_Information-Specifications-vita,Start-up_Image/1/

!!Other Settings
__Rendering__

''Static Batching''
* Static batching allows the engine to reduce draw calls for geometry of any size (provided it does not move and shares the same material). Static batching is significantly more efficient than dynamic batching. You should choose static batching as it will require less CPU power.

''Dynamic Batching''
* Unity can automatically batch moving objects into the same draw call if they share the same material and fulfill other criteria. Dynamic batching is done automatically and does not require any additional effort on your side.

The benefits of static and dynamic batching can vary greatly from game to game. Ganeral information and tips on using Static and Dynamic bacthing is available at http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html

''GPU Skinning''
* Uses SX11/ES3 GPU Skinning to greatly increase the rendering speed of skinned meshes.

__Configuration__

''Power Mode''
* Controls the GPU Clock frequency
** Mode A (Normal)
** Mode B (GPU High - No WLAN or COM)
** Mode C (GPU High - No Camera, OLED Low brightness)

More information can be found at https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/vita-en,Power-Overview-vita,Power_Configuration_Control/1/


''Override PSVita Music''
* Acquires the PS Vita's BMG port pausing any background music which might be playing

__Optimization__

''API Compatibility Level''
* .NET 2.0
** This is close to the full .NET 2.0 API and offers the best compatibility with pre-existing .NET code. Application's build size and startup time may be relatively poor.
* .NET 2.0 Subset
** This is close to the Mono "monotouch" profile. The advantage of using this profile is reduced build size (and startup time) but this comes at the expense of compatibility with existing .NET code.

Note that .Net 2.0 subset has limited compatibility with other libraries. More information can be found at http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/limitations/ 

''AOT Compilation Options''
* Allows you to set compilation options for the mono Ahead Of Time compiler.

''Stripping Level''
* Setting a Stipping Level in the Player Settings can potentially reduce your game's memory footprint quite considerably. The options are:
** Disabled
** Strip Assemblies
** Stip ByteCode
** Use micro mscorlib

These optimisation levels are cumulative, so level 3 optimisation implicitly includes levels 2 and 1, while level 2 optimization includes level 1.

See the [[http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/index.php?n=Main.PSVitaStrippingLevels|PSVita: Stipping Levels]] page for detailed information.

''Optimize Mesh Data''
* Remove unused mesh components

''Mesh Video Mem''
* How many megabytes of video memory to use for mesh data before we use main memory. Typically this option is left at 0 but if you find you are running short of system memory it can be useful to increase this number.

!!Publishing Settings
__Live Area__

LiveArea is an area provided for each game which optionally enables the enjoyment of a game to be shared among users, thereby facilitating more active communication. The default LiveArea allows you to implement a very basic LiveArea, providing only a background image and gate image used to launch your game.

PNG is the only image format that is supported in the current version. Indexing (color reduced) is recommended.

''Background''
* 840x500 pixels in size
* 8bit

''Gate Image''
* 280x158 pixels in size

__Custom Live Area__

For a more involved user experience Unity allows you to customise LiveArea with your own images and content.

''Live Area folder''
* Specify a folder within the project assets folder that contains your Live Area data
* Note that use of a Custom Live Area will override settings in the Default LiveArea section.

The LiveArea Editor tool can be used to create your LiveArea data. The LiveArea Editor is a Windows tools that allows you to use a GUI to create or edit the XML describing the screen configuration of contents information zone of LiveArea. This tool is included in the PS Vita SDK.

Detailed information on LiveArea is available at https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/livareastarting/1/ and information on Content Information Zone XML can be found at https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/vita-en,LiveArea-Specifications-vita,Content_Information_Zone_XML_Specifications#_Ref290252884

__Software Manual__

''Manual folder''
* Specify a folder within the project assets folder that contains your application manual

The software manual consists of a series of PNG images that are displayed when the user views the software manual.

Information on software manual image specifications can be found here::
https://psvita.scedev.net/docs/vita-en,Content_Information-Specifications-vita,Software_Manual/1/
