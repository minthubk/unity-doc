! PSVita: Profiling
!! Unity Profiler
There are two ways to connect the Unity profiler to your running game.

The unity editor can attach automatically to your PSVita when doing a Build & Run.

#In Build Settings set your Build Type to PC Hosted
#Tick the Development Build button
#Tick the Autoconnect Profiler button
#Click Build & Run to run your game on the device. The Unity profiler will automatically open and connect when the game starts
#Use the profiler as usual.

You can manually attach the Unity profiler to a running development build version of your game.

#Run your development build on the device
#Open the Profiler window Windows->Profiler.
#Select PSVIta Player (IP) as the active profiler.
#Use the profiler as usual.

More information about the Unity Profiler is available in the [[http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/index.php?n=Main.Profiler|Profiler documentation]] .

!!Problems Connecting?

If you are having problems connecting the profiler to your device it's worth checking the following points:

#Make sure the host pc and the devkit are on the same subnet (wifi)
#Make sure multicast packets are allowed between wifi peers (no wifi peer isolation enabled)
#In the devkit TTY locate the output regarding player connection for possibly helpful information
#Verify IP address/port can be reached from hostpc (e.g. telnet <ip> <port>)
